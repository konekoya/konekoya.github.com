# konekoya.github.com
My personal website hosting on Github

not sure if I will use this as my personal blog or not

#TODO
1. Use this as my personal site. It should include my social networking links, github link and blog?
2. This site could be a good reference http://www.randyjensen.com/
3. Use one page scroll plugin for this site?
